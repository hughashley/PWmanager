I know that writing my passwords down is not a secure method of storing them.  Since I am not comfortable writing my passwords down on paper, I want a method of securely storing them that is easy to access and use.

I recently had my Netflix account hacked and I need a secure way to store my password, so that I do not need to remember it.

I do not like creating secure passwords because they are more difficult to remember.  I would be much more willing to create more secure passwords if I had a safe way to store them.
